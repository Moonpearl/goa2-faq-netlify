Many of her cards check for “empty minion spawn points in the battle zone.” These are the minion spawn points printed on the board, but only the ones in the current battle zone — there is only 1 battle zone (2, on the 2-lane map). Only empty spaces (with **nothing** on them) are counted.",

Dodger cannot “respawn” a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",
