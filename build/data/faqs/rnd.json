Many of her cards check for “empty minion spawn points in the battle zone.” These are the minion spawn points printed on the board, but only the ones in the current battle zone — there is only 1 battle zone (2, on the 2-lane map). Only empty spaces (with **nothing** on them) are counted.",

Dodger cannot “respawn” a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",

If he does so, he will be immune and can move through units during the next turn. Remember that immunity means he cannot be targeted or affected by any action, can move through tokens (not stop movement on them), and may ignore token effects.",

If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card “fizzles” — stops resolving — and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n - Note that Tiger can move next to an enemy hero with no coins (or whom he chooses not to rob) in order to get the full movement.\n - If Tigerclaw is not able to move 2 spaces in a straight line, he will not make the final movement at all.\n - There are cases where performing Primary Green without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien’s Alt Blue or Xargatha’s Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.",
