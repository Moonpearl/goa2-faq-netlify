        "a": "Tigerclaw must begin his turn adjacent to an obstacle (including any unit), then place himself into a space in radius that is not adjacent to an enemy unit. If he does so, he will be immune and can move through units during the next turn. Remember that immunity means he cannot be targeted or affected by any action, can move through tokens (not stop movement on them), and may ignore token effects.",

        "q": "Does Tigerclaw’s Primary Green skill require an enemy hero?",
        "a": "Yes, to perform it completely. After Tigerclaw performs the first movement on the card, it checks for an adjacent enemy hero to steal from. If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card “fizzles” — stops resolving — and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n --- \nThere are cases where performing the action without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien’s Alt Blue or Xargatha’s Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.",
