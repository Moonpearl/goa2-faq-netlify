If they do so and the discarded Card has a movement value, that Hero must then move that distance in a straight line. They would only be unable to do so (and therefore stay on the same space) if they could not move the full movement value in a straight line in any of the 6 directions from their current space.",

That Hero then picks one of the two options, regardless of whether they will have any effect. In other words, the card won’t “work” unless Whisper is adjacent to a Minion.\n Note that on Tier III, Whisper can target 3 minions simultaneously. He cannot use this action to defeat the last non-Heavy Minion at the same time as the Heavy.",
