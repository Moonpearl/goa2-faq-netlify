A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.\n- Brogan can charge next to an immune unit, at which point his attack would fizzle.\n- Brogan can charge through Min’s Smoke Bomb Token, since the Smoke Bomb only prevents targeting across the Smoke Bomb and Brogan would not target until after the movement.",
