        "q": "How does Wasp’s Static Barrier work?",
        "a": "Static Barrier divides the map into 2 regions: spaces within its radius and outside its radius. Enemy units cannot **move** or **fast travel** across the “barrier” between the two regions:\n- They cannot take a move action (to move or fast travel) to move across the barrier.\n- They cannot use an attack or skill involving movement to cross the barrier.\n- They cannot cross the barrier on their path, even if they cross back. That is, a hero outside the barrier cannot walk into the radius and then walk back out.\n- They can use a “place” or “swap” effect (such as Arien’s Alt Blue) to cross the barrier.\n- They can be pushed across the barrier (pushing is not movement) or moved by another player’s card.",

        "a": "This card pushes adjacent enemies away from you (in a straight line). If an enemy Hero cannot be pushed the full distance, because an obstacle is located along the straight line path, the Hero is forced to discard.",
