They are related but different:\n\n- When you would take a Movement action, you can fast travel instead.\n- If you use a primary Movement action to Fast Travel, you would ignore the card text, since you are replacing the action.\n- A card that lets you move (“Move 2 spaces…”) would not let you Fast Travel instead.\n- If you are prevented from moving or from taking a Movement action, you could not use a Movement action to Fast Travel.\n- If you are limited in how you move (“May only move 1 space”), you may still Fast Travel as normal, since you are allowed to select, then replace, the Movement action (and Fast Travel is a placement, not movement).",
