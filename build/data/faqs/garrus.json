There are several valid options for movement: you could move to a different space adjacent to the hero you attacked, or if you are adjacent to a different enemy hero, you may move to another space adjacent to them. You may not move away from your initial target to a different enemy hero that was not originally adjacent to you, since the original target would have been the nearest enemy hero.",
