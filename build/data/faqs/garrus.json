There are several valid options for movement:\n- You could move to a different space adjacent to the hero you attacked\n - You may move and end the movement adjacent to a different enemy hero.\n - You may move and end the movement adjacent multiple enemy heroes (you can still only choose one of them as your target)\n If you cannot end your movement next to an enemey hero, you cannot move at all after the attack.",
