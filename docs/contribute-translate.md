# Add language support

Some terms like Hero names and Card names were not translated deliberately to simplify the
mental mapping of information between the FAQ and the physical cards players hold in their
hands. Everything else can be translated into your local language - to the benefit of every
player with weak english skill, who still wishes to learn and enjoy Guards!

If you can provide me with a translated version of the original [english language](../public/locales/en.json)
file, I will happily add it to the FAQ. New translations can be provided via Pull Request or as a
[Github Issue](https://github.com/yvo-niedrich/goa2-faq/issues/new?title=Language%20Support%3A%20%3CLANG%3E&labels=%22help%20wanted%22).

__HINT__: I will freely admit that I used AI tools to help me out with the translations. The result
still needed some manual touches, but it made a tedious task a lot more pleasant and quick. For
inspiration have a look at my [prompt](../public/locales/de_ai_instructions.md) to facilitate the
the translation of rules and FAQs into German.
