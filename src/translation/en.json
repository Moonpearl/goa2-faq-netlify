It also will **not** restrict movement as part of other actions (such as Brogan‚Äôs Primary Red or Tigerclaw‚Äôs Primary Green).\nAdditionally, because movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of a movement, a Hero can freely move into and through the radius of Arien‚Äôs effect without being affected.",

Only empty spaces (with **nothing** on them) are counted.",
    "faq-dod-2.question": "What minions can Dodger respawn with her Necromancy?",
    "faq-dod-2.answer": "She can return a friendly defeated/removed minion of any type to any spawn point. \n- It need not be a matching minion type or color: if her friendly ranged minion is defeated, Dodger could respawn it on an enemy melee minion spawn point. \n- It must be a minion that was originally in play in this wave, before being defeated or removed. Dodger cannot ‚Äúrespawn‚Äù a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",
    "faq-xar-1.question": "What does Xargatha's Stone Gaze affect and not affect?",
    "faq-xar-1.answer": "It prevents ‚Äúmovement actions‚Äù, that is, selecting the movement option when resolving a card:\n - They **can‚Äôt** use a normal movement action to move.\n - They **can‚Äôt** use a movement action to fast travel (which chooses, then replaces, a movement action).\n - They **can** use a ‚Äúplace‚Äù or ‚Äúswap‚Äù effect (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue).\n - The **can** be pushed or moved by another effect (if the effect ignores immunity).\n - They **can** take another action type that involves movement (such as Brogan‚Äôs Primary Red) or a Fast Travel (Silverarrow‚Äôs Gold).",
    "faq-xar-2.question": "Does Xargatha's Constrict affect heavy minions as well?",
    "faq-xar-2.answer": "No. Initially you can only kill **melee** minions, but on Tier 3 you can get melee or ranged minions, but never the heavy minion."
