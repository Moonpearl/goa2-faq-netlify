    "faq-ari-2.question": "Do Arien‚Äôs green skill cards perform movement?",
    "faq-ari-2.answer": "No. The primary Green **places** Arien, the alternative Green **swaps**. These are not movement and are not restricted by effects that restrict movement.",
    "faq-ari-3.question": "What does Arien's Slippery Ground restrict?",
    "faq-ari-3.answer": "This card restricts the movement, by a movement action, of Heroes in radius. It will **not** affect pushing, swapping, or placement effects (including fast travel!). It also will **not** restrict movement as part of other actions (such as Brogan‚Äôs Primary Red or Tigerclaw‚Äôs Primary Green).\nAdditionally, because movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of a movement, a Hero can freely move into and through the radius of Arien‚Äôs effect without being affected.",
    "faq-common-1.question": "What does immunity protect from?",
    "faq-common-1.answer": " Basically everything. An immune unit can‚Äôt be targeted or affected by any action. They can choose to move through and ignore tokens.",
    "faq-common-2.question": "Why is there a range 1 attack? Isn‚Äôt that non-ranged?",
    "faq-common-2.answer": "A range of 1 can only target an adjacent space (but the range may be increased by items or other effects). A range of 0 has no targets.\nSome cards **explicitly** interact with ranged or non-ranged attacks.",
    "faq-dod-1.question": "What is an ‚Äúempty minion spawn point in the battle zone‚Äù?",
    "faq-dod-1.answer": "Dodger‚Äôs magic (thematically) grows stronger as minions are defeated. Many of her cards check for ‚Äúempty minion spawn points in the battle zone.‚Äù These are the minion spawn points printed on the board, but only the ones in the current battle zone ‚Äî there is only 1 battle zone (2, on the 2-lane map). Only empty spaces (with **nothing** on them) are counted.",
    "faq-dod-2.question": "What minions can Dodger respawn with her Necromancy?",
    "faq-dod-2.answer": "She can return a friendly defeated/removed minion of any type to any spawn point. \n- It need not be a matching minion type or color: if her friendly ranged minion is defeated, Dodger could respawn it on an enemy melee minion spawn point. \n- It must be a minion that was originally in play in this wave, before being defeated or removed. Dodger cannot ‚Äúrespawn‚Äù a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",
    "faq-sabina-1.question": "Does Sabina gain the attack bonus against Heroes who have played but not resolved an attack card?",
    "faq-sabina-1.answer": "Yes: the card only checks for Heroes that **played** an attack card, regardless of whether they‚Äôve resolved the action, which action they performed, and even whether this is still their card for the turn (it will ‚Äúremember‚Äù whether they have played a card, even if it is discarded or switched for another card by an effect).",
    "faq-tig-1.question": "Does Tigerclaw‚Äôs Blink Strike attack require movement?",
    "faq-tig-1.answer": "Yes! If Tigerclaw cannot move through the target in a straight line, the effect will ‚Äúfizzle‚Äù ‚Äî stop resolving ‚Äî and he will not attack. A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.",
    "faq-tig-2.question": "How does Tigerclaw‚Äôs Silver (Blend into Shadows) activate?",
    "faq-tig-2.answer": "Tigerclaw must begin his turn adjacent to an obstacle (including any unit), then place himself into a space in radius that is not adjacent to an enemy unit. If he does so, he will be immune and can move through units during the next turn. Remember that immunity means he cannot be targeted or affected by any action, can move through tokens (not stop movement on them), and may ignore token effects.",
    "faq-tig-3.question": "Does Tigerclaw‚Äôs green thievery skill require an enemy hero?",
    "faq-tig-3.answer": "Yes, to perform it completely. After Tigerclaw performs the first movement on the card, it checks for an adjacent enemy hero to steal from. If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card ‚Äúfizzles‚Äù ‚Äî stops resolving ‚Äî and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n - Note that Tigerclaw can move next to an enemy hero with no coins (or whom he chooses not to rob) in order to get the full movement.\n - If Tigerclaw is not able to move 2 spaces in a straight line, he will not make the final movement at all.\n - There are cases where performing Primary Green without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue or Xargatha‚Äôs Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.",
    "faq-tig-4.question": "What happens if Tigerclaw‚Äôs poison reduces a value below 1?",
    "faq-tig-4.answer": "Values can drop to 0 and even be negative:\n- Initiative values are resolved in the normal order from highest to lowest.\n- Negative defense values are calculated normally and may still block an attack if the Defense Total is greater than or equal to the Attack Total.\n- Negative Attack Totals will still defeat a Minion and must still be defended against (or will defeat the hero).",
    "faq-wasp-1.question": "How does Wasp‚Äôs Static Barrier work?",
    "faq-wasp-1.answer": "Static Barrier divides the map into 2 regions: spaces within its radius and outside its radius. Enemy units cannot **move** or **fast travel** across the ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù between the two regions:\n- They cannot take a move action (to move or fast travel) to move across the barrier.\n- They cannot use an attack or skill involving movement to cross the barrier.\n- They cannot cross the barrier on their path, even if they cross back. That is, a hero outside the barrier cannot walk into the radius and then walk back out.\n- They can use a ‚Äúplace‚Äù or ‚Äúswap‚Äù effect (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue) to cross the barrier.\n- They can be pushed across the barrier (pushing is not movement) or moved by another player‚Äôs card.",
    "faq-wasp-3.question": "How does Wasp‚Äôs ability move units and tokens?",
    "faq-wasp-3.answer": "The target cannot move farther away or closer, so the distance between you and the target must remain unchanged.",
    "faq-wasp-4.question": "When does Wasp‚Äôs  push ability force a discard?",
    "faq-wasp-4.answer": "This card pushes adjacent enemies away from you (in a straight line). If an enemy Hero cannot be pushed the full distance, because an obstacle is located along the straight line path, the Hero is forced to discard.",
    "faq-wasp-5.question": "Why do Wasp‚Äôs Tier II and III abilities say ‚ÄúIf you do‚Äù? Why would the block fail?",
    "faq-wasp-5.answer": "You can always discard a card to attempt to defend, even if it does not defend successfully.",
    "faq-xar-1.question": "What does Xargatha's Stone Gaze affect and not affect?",
    "faq-xar-1.answer": "It prevents ‚Äúmovement actions‚Äù, that is, selecting the movement option when resolving a card:\n - They **can‚Äôt** use a normal movement action to move.\n - They **can‚Äôt** use a movement action to fast travel (which chooses, then replaces, a movement action).\n - They **can** use a ‚Äúplace‚Äù or ‚Äúswap‚Äù effect (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue).\n - The **can** be pushed or moved by another effect (if the effect ignores immunity).\n - They **can** take another action type that involves movement (such as Brogan‚Äôs Primary Red) or a Fast Travel (Silverarrow‚Äôs Gold).",
    "faq-xar-2.question": "Does Xargatha's Constrict affect heavy minions as well?",
    "faq-xar-2.answer": "No. Initially you can only kill **melee** minions, but on Tier 3 you can get melee or ranged minions, but never the heavy minion."
