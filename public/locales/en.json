Many of her cards check for “empty minion spawn points in the battle zone.” These are the minion spawn points printed on the board, but only the ones in the current battle zone — there is only 1 battle zone (2, on the 2-lane map). Only empty spaces (with **nothing** on them) are counted.",
    "faq-dod-36mZD5jZ.question": "Why and how would Dodger remove her own friendly minions?",
    "faq-dod-36mZD5jZ.answer": "Several of Dodger’s cards become more powerful with empty minion spawn points near her. Some of her cards allow her to remove her own friendly minions, which helps her achieve this more quickly (and may remove a minion that an opponent will soon defeat anyway). Removing a friendly minion does _not_ earn Dodger coins. Heroes can never **attack** their own friendly units.",
    "faq-dod-uU82U9DL.question": "When does Dodger’s Tier III Primary Red card prevent retrieval?",
    "faq-dod-uU82U9DL.answer": "As soon as the unit is targeted. If a hero defended with a defense action that retrieves a card, they would not be able to retrieve the card.",
    "faq-dod-73Ipv84g.question": "When Dodger uses another card’s action with her Alt Blue cards, what weird things can happen?",
    "faq-dod-73Ipv84g.answer": "Here are some possibilities:\n- Active effects Dodger copies will work normally. The effect remains, even if the originally copied card changes state or the hero is defeated.\n- If Dodger copies cards that specifically refer to Tokens, she uses those tokens as those heroes would (such as Min’s grenade or smoke bomb, or Wuk’s trees).\n- However, when placing Tokens with special properties, the properties are still defined by the originating Hero’s card, since Heroes do not “own” Tokens. The two big examples are that Tali’s Alt Green (_Glacial Barrier_) places a Token that has an Initiative penalty to Tali’s enemies (not Dodger’s), and Min’s Blue (_Trip Mine_) places Mines as Dodger chooses, but they would force discards against Min’s enemies (not Dodger’s). So, probably don’t copy these cards.\n- Dodger can copy Trinkets’ cards to remove and/or place the Turret.\n- If Dodger copies an action that says “this card”, it means the card with the printed ability, not Dodger’s. She cannot copy Brogan’s Silver (_Bullwark_), for example, then retrieve her card.\n- Dodger’s Alt Blue is a skill card, so some card resolutions may happen differently. Examples:\n  - If Dodger copies a non-ranged attack, she is performing a non-ranged attack (even though her Blue card is an area-skill).\n  - If Dodger copies an attack and Bain blocks with his Primary Green (_Close Call_), Dodger would not pick up her Blue card, since she is not playing an attack card.\n  - If Dodger copies Trinkets’ Primary Red (_Makeshift Minigun_), she will gain a range bonus. If she is subsequently hit by Wasp’s Gold (_Dazzling Dagger_), the active +range bonus copied from Trinkets is canceled).\n- If Dodger copies Xargatha’s Green (_Charming Aura_), both heroes may try to “convert” the surrounding minions: these are resolved starting with the team shown on the tie-breaker coin, without flipping it (see Rulebook, p. 18). This means that the tiebreaker coin team may convert several minions to friendly, then the non-tiebreaker team may convert them back, as well as any others that were already enemies.\n- Dodger cannot copy the card of an immune hero.",
    "faq-dod-uF7N41Hk.question": "If Dodger removes her friendly Heavy Minion with her Primary Green card, which happens first, the push or a chance to collect a coin?",
    "faq-dod-uF7N41Hk.answer": "Pushing the Lane happens immediately, even in the middle of an action. If Dodger is down to only the Heavy Minion for her team and she plays her Primary Green, she would be able to remove the Heavy (since it is no longer immune), would not collect coins (it is removing, not defeating), and the Lane would immediately Push. This means the “Battle Zone” has now shifted to the new zone, which does not have empty minion spawn points, so she will not normally be able to collect a coin from the effect on her card.",
    "faq-dod-9oAe2b05.question": "What minions can Dodger respawn with her Alternative Green card?",
    "faq-dod-9oAe2b05.answer": "She can return a friendly defeated/removed minion of any type to any spawn point. \n- It need not be a matching minion type or color: if her friendly ranged minion is defeated, Dodger could respawn it on an enemy melee minion spawn point. \n- It must be a minion that was originally in play in this wave, before being defeated or removed. Dodger cannot “respawn” a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",
    "faq-gar-XgL3MPkL.question": "Does Garrus’s Silver (Chilling Howl) slow an enemy moving into radius from outside?",
    "faq-gar-XgL3MPkL.answer": "No. Movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of movement, so a hero within Garrus’s radius is affected, but a hero moving into the radius will complete their full movement value.",
    "faq-gar-RuXRiXjv.question": "Can Garrus’s Alt Reds (Blunt Force) move away from the attacked hero to another?",
    "faq-gar-RuXRiXjv.answer": "If your attack against an opposing hero does not defeat them, they will still be adjacent to you. There are several valid options for movement:\n- You could move to a different space adjacent to the hero you attacked\n - You may move and end the movement adjacent to a different enemy hero.\n - You may move and end the movement adjacent multiple enemy heroes (you can still only choose one of them as your target)\n If you cannot end your movement next to an enemey hero, you cannot move at all after the attack.",
    "faq-gyd-K3e6TuJP.question": "Does \"Energy Drain\" require a non-immune enemy hero in range for my team to be able to regain 1 spent Life counter?",
    "faq-gyd-K3e6TuJP.answer": "Yes, you need to be able to target a hero first.\n\"If able\" after a comma makes the preceding step non-mandatory (p. 17), so it only applies to the \"discard\" step of the instructions.",
    "faq-mis-9icT8gG7.question": "Misa’s Gold “ignores the effects of tokens.” What does that include?",
    "faq-mis-9icT8gG7.answer": "Misa ignores the effects of tokens themselves, but not Actions or Active Effects that use those tokens.\n- She would ignore Min’s Mines and Smoke Bomb and Tali’s Ice Tokens. She could still be forced to discard by Min’s Grenade (an Active Effect) or targeted by Wuk’s Primary Red (_Nature’s Protector_), which only requires her to be adjacent to a Tree Token.",
    "faq-mis-872OuVpW.question": "What does Misa’s Silver force Heroes to do?",
    "faq-mis-872OuVpW.answer": "The only requirement of Swoop In is that heroes in radius must target Misa with attack actions if she is an eligible target. They would not be forced to target Misa in the following examples:\n- An enemy hero may use an attack for another action, such as movement, instead.\n- An enemy hero with a targeting restriction on their attack may not be able to target Misa, and would be unaffected. Swift’s Primary Red (_Prepared Shot_) targets a non-adjacent unit. If Swift is adjacent to Misa, she is not allowed to shoot Misa, so she can ignore Swoop In and pick any valid target.\n- An enemy hero with movement before their attack may move freely, and then choose a different target — even if they had an option to move and target Misa — as long as Misa is not a valid target after their movement. Tigerclaw’s Gold (_Blink Strike_) moves 2 spaces through a unit and then targets the unit. He could move through and attack a different target, even if Misa would have been an option, since Tigerclaw freely picks his movement before Swoop In restricts his targeting.\n- Note that a unit moving into Misa’s radius as part of another action would be affected by Swoop In after their movement. If they target after their movement, and Misa is a valid target, they must target her. Brogan’s Primary Red (_Mad Dash_) moves several spaces and then targets. Brogan can make any valid move, but if he ends in Misa’s radius, he must target her if she is a valid target, even if he began the charge outside of the radius.",
    "faq-mis-gfW2c17j.question": "If Misa plays Silver and then discards for some other reason, does she gain coins?",
    "faq-mis-gfW2c17j.answer": "Yes. If Misa has Swoop In active, she gains coins for her first discard, regardless of the reason.",
    "faq-mis-kUOh8C68.question": "How and why does Misa’s Tier III Red restrict her target so they “cannot choose to not defend”?",
    "faq-mis-kUOh8C68.answer": "Misa’s target must discard a card to defend, if able, even if the defense will not be successful. Normally a hero who is unable to defend successfully will not defend at all, to have more cards after respawning — in this case, Misa’s victim is forced to defend unsuccessfully.",
    "faq-mis-c4Vl76z2.question": "Does Misa’s Alt Red Push its target?",
    "faq-mis-c4Vl76z2.answer": "No. The effect is not a Push, and does not work like a Push. Misa can choose the movement, as long as it ends up in a space farther than it was before the movement.",
    "faq-mis-7y5Ocd8c.question": "Misa’s Primary Blue ignores obstacles. Does this ignore tokens?",
    "faq-mis-7y5Ocd8c.answer": "Actually, no! “Ignoring Obstacles” means moving freely through them, but their effects are still applied. For example, Min’s Mines would still trigger after she moves through them (an effect of the token).",
    "faq-mis-V58R7KUy.question": "If Misa uses Primary Green, can she resolve the same card twice with different actions?",
    "faq-mis-V58R7KUy.answer": "No. Misa’s Primary Green repeats an action, it doesn’t play the card twice, so the same action is used on the repeat.",
    "faq-mis-Y7w06Zrr.question": "If Misa uses Primary Green to repeat an action, and she plays Silver afterwards, does she gain double the money?",
    "faq-mis-Y7w06Zrr.answer": "No. Repeating an action with an Active Effect does not duplicate the Active Effect, so Misa could not gain extra coins for a discard (or multiple discards).",
    "faq-mor-oiXBV41f.question": "Can I take Zombie tokens from the board if all Zombie tokens are already in play?",
    "faq-mor-oiXBV41f.answer": "Yes. Tokens should come from the Supply first, but if you need to place more tokens than are available in the supply, first remove up to that number of tokens of the same type from the board. Page 18 of the rulebook under \"Place\" clarifies this in further detail.",
    "faq-mor-VRbthTGv.question": "If I cannot defend against an attack, can I still discard this to place the Zombie tokens?",
    "faq-mor-VRbthTGv.answer": "Yes. You can always play a card to defend even if the Defense value does not allow you to successfully defend. As this is a Defense/Skill card, you are allowed to place the Zombie tokens. (See p. 14 for more detail.)",
    "faq-neb-QxJOvtUS.question": "Interactions with NebKher’s Gold (Mind Grip)?",
    "faq-neb-QxJOvtUS.answer": "This card has lots of weird interactions:\n- Mind Grip is only played as a skill action on your turn. You could not use Mind Grip’s copy ability to copy a card while defending.\n- Active effects he copies will work normally, as though NebKher’s Gold was an exact copy of the card. The effect remains, even if the originally copied card changes state or the hero is defeated.\n- When NebKher copies effects that place tokens, he places Illusion tokens instead. They will not take on the properties of the copied tokens.\n- If NebKher copies cards that specifically refer to tokens, NebKher uses those tokens as those heroes would (such as Min’s mines or smoke bombs, or Wuk’s trees).\n- NebKher can copy Trinkets’ cards to remove and/or place the Turret.\n- If NebKher copies an action that says “this card”, it means the card with the printed ability, not Neb’s. He cannot copy Brogan’s Silver (Bullwark), for example, then retrieve his Gold.\n- Although it can copy attacks, Mind Grip is a skill card, so some card resolutions may happen differently. Examples:\n     - If NebKher copies a non-ranged attack, he is performing a non-ranged attack (even though his Gold card is a ranged skill). A non-ranged attack he is using could not be blocked by Tigerclaw’s Primary Blue (Dodge) or Wasp’s Primary Green (Stop Projectiles), both of which only block ranged attacks.\n- If NebKher copies Igantia’s Silver (Moment of Equilibrium), he will re-set the coin to a side of his choice. (Ignatia only prevents ties from changing it.)\n- NebKher cannot copy the card of an immune hero.",

    "faq-neb-nRunMRdC.question": "What about units on the line drawn by NebKher’s Alt Blue (Crack in Reality)?",
    "faq-neb-nRunMRdC.answer": "Units on the line can affect and be affected by units on both sides.",
    "faq-raz-YvsEXe2a.question": "Each instance of Razzle is “the same hero, except when actions are performed.” Is that only when your own actions are performed, or when enemy actions are performed as well?",
    "faq-raz-YvsEXe2a.answer": "During any action, regardless of whether it is performed by your enemy, ally or yourself, all the Razzles other than the active one is considered “another hero”.\n\nCards such as Mortimer’s Crawling Dead (which let you affect “another enemy hero in radius”) or Xargatha's Cleave (which can be repeated on a “different enemy hero”) can target Razzle twice by targeting two Razzle figures.\n\nIt is therefore very important to not have multiple Razzles near a hero that has multi-target discards as it is an easy way to be card killed.",
    "faq-sabina-AR1boyR4.question": "Does Sabina gain the attack bonus against Heroes who have played but not resolved an attack card?",
    "faq-sabina-AR1boyR4.answer": "Yes: the card only checks for Heroes that **played** an attack card, regardless of whether they’ve resolved the action, which action they performed, and even whether this is still their card for the turn (it will “remember” whether they have played a card, even if it is discarded or switched for another card by an effect).",
    "faq-sabina-842FGqW2.question": "How does Sabina’s Tier III Primary Blue card treat friendly minions “as both melee and ranged”?",
    "faq-sabina-842FGqW2.answer": "Such minions would apply their penalties to adjacent units and ranged units, giving -2 Defense to an adjacent Hero.",
    "faq-sil-VBPVBU86.question": "When can Silverarrow’s Gold Fast Travel?",
    "faq-sil-VBPVBU86.answer": "The Fast Travel has all the normal restrictions of a Fast Travel action: there must be no enemy Heroes or Minions in her Zone, and if not, she can move anywhere in her Zone or to an adjacent Zone with no enemy Heroes or Minions.\n_Note that this is a rare instance of a Fast Travel which is not replacing a movement action. Silverarrow could Fast Travel (if valid), even if she cannot move due to another effect._",
    "faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.question": "Does Silverarrow’s Primary Blue affect a Hero who moves in range of Silverarrow during their movement?",
    "faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.answer": "No, movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of the movement.",
    "faq-sil-4vXYYv56.question": "How does the timing of Silverarrow’s Alt Blue relate to immunity that lasts for the turn?",
    "faq-sil-4vXYYv56.answer": "Active Effects that trigger at “End of Turn”, such as Silverarrow’s Alt Blue, still happen during the turn. If a Hero is immune during that turn, they are still immune to the discard.",
    "faq-swi-6Iy6RJQH.question": "How can Swift's Silver card already be resolved while its action is being performed?",
    "faq-swi-6Iy6RJQH.answer": "If this card is played before Swift's Gold card, it will already be resolved when the Gold card triggers it again.",
    "faq-tal-sA6IR13i.question": "What happens when Tali’s Gold targets a Hero?",
    "faq-tal-sA6IR13i.answer": "The targeted hero must have an unresolved card. They choose to either return the card to their hand (they will not take an action this turn), or, Tali names a color of card for them to discard, if able.\n- An enemy target must pick between losing their action for the turn (retrieving the card) or losing another card of Tali’s choice from hand.\n- Targeting friendly heroes, Tali is “over-healing” the hero, keeping an extra card in hand for the round and making them more difficult to kill. (If Tali has and her teammate find that they disagree strategically, the teammate could refuse to return the card. Tali could then safely name that color to prevent them from discarding.)",
    "faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.question": "What communication is legal for Tali’s Silver?",
    "faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.answer": "All Table Talk and Communication is fully open - to teammates and opponents (p. 4). A Tali player can give teammates instructions like “Say Blue” or “Say Red if Sabina plays Gold, otherwise say Green,” as long as the opponents can hear (and understand) these instructions. The Tali player may _not_ secretly indicate their desire to their teammates by whispering, gestures, showing cards, a private code, etc.",
    "faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.question": "If Tali tries to resolve her Silver and her whole team is dead or immune, what happens?",
    "faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.answer": "No friendly hero can be chosen and the card does nothing.",

    "faq-tal-g9x1Ca07.answer": "The active effect of Tali’s card is canceled, so the opponent never retrieves their card. Through death, Tali scored an extra hit.",
    "faq-tal-pX35L9un.question": "How would Tali’s Tier I Primary Green place 1 Ice Token next to another Ice Token?",
    "faq-tal-pX35L9un.answer": "Since it only places 1 Ice Token, and they’re removed at the end of the round, it usually can’t. Some copy effects or other weird cases can cause it to happen.",
    "faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.question": "Tali’s Alternate Green makes a Totem that can protect a minion. If the Totem is removed, does the Hero gain coins?",
    "faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.answer": "No. The Totem is removed instead of the minion being defeated, so no minion is defeated and no coins are gained.",
    "faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.question": "Does Tigerclaw’s Gold attack require movement?",
    "faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.answer": "Yes! If Tigerclaw cannot move through the target in a straight line, the effect will “fizzle” — stop resolving — and he will not attack. A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.",
    "faq-tig-VhE684Ew.question": "How does Tigerclaw’s Silver card activate?",
    "faq-tig-VhE684Ew.answer": "Tigerclaw must begin his turn adjacent to an obstacle (including any unit), then place himself into a space in radius that is not adjacent to an enemy unit. If he does so, he will be immune and can move through units during the next turn. Remember that immunity means he cannot be targeted or affected by any action, can move through tokens (not stop movement on them), and may ignore token effects.",
    "faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.question": "Does Tigerclaw’s Primary Green skill require an enemy hero?",
    "faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.answer": "Yes, to perform it completely. After Tigerclaw performs the first movement on the card, it checks for an adjacent enemy hero to steal from. If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card “fizzles” — stops resolving — and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n --- \nThere are cases where performing the action without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien’s Alt Blue or Xargatha’s Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.",
    "faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.question": "What happens if Tigerclaw’s poison reduces a value below 1?",
    "faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.answer": "Values can drop to 0 and even be negative:\n- Initiative values are resolved in the normal order from highest to lowest.\n- Negative defense values are calculated normally and may still block an attack if the Defense Total is greater than or equal to the Attack Total.\n- Negative Attack Totals will still defeat a Minion and must still be defended against (or will defeat the hero).",
    "faq-tri-Gy7gS7zz.question": "What is the Turret?",
    "faq-tri-Gy7gS7zz.answer": "It’s an obstacle and counts as terrain. It’s not a unit, minion, or hero, and it doesn’t do anything other than as instructed by Trinkets’ cards. The Turret’s presence and counting as terrain are properties, not an active effect, so they don’t change if Trinkets’ cards change zones, between rounds, or if Trinkets dies. You’re limited to the single provided Turret, so placing a Turret while it’s already on the map will reposition it, not add a Turret. Several of Trinkets’ effects require a target in range of Trinkets and the Turret, measuring the range of both of these independently.",
    "faq-tri-Q91NHrfO.question": "How do Trinkets cards target?",
    "faq-tri-Q91NHrfO.answer": "Several of Trinkets cards target based on the location of the Turret. While thematically the Turret is shooting them, Trinkets is still the one playing these cards, targeting enemies, etc.: the Turret only provides a targeting restriction. Therefore:\n- Arien’s Silver (Spell Break) could prevent a nearby Trinkets from using skills like Primary Blue (Disruptor Jolt) or Alt Green (Self-Destruct), even if the Turret is far away.\n- Min’s Silver (Smoke Bomb) can interrupt a Trinkets attack if the Smoke Bomb is between Trinkets and the taret, irrespective of the position of the Turret.",
    "faq-urs-ib4a4DV0.question": "If Ursafar discards Silver to defend, is he still enraged?",

    "faq-urs-reTuR399.question": "When Ursafar’s Alternate Blue is Active, can Heroes move next to him? Can they move away from him?",
    "faq-urs-reTuR399.answer": "Yes. Enemy Heroes cannot move through spaces adjacent to Ursafar. As the reminder text on Tier II indicates, they can move into or out of an adjacent space, but not both.",
    "faq-urs-Il223e44.question": "Would Ursafar’s Ultimate allow him to move using his Silver?",

    "faq-wasp-W273D7Gg.question": "How does Wasp’s Gold card work?",
    "faq-wasp-W273D7Gg.answer": "After attacking, any enemy Heroes adjacent to you cancel their active effects. Active effects have bold text saying “Next turn:”, “This round:”, etc. and are turned sideways. This includes Active effects that are not yet in effect (for example, Min’s Alt Blue, (_Death Grenade_), is an “End of turn:” Active effect that would still be canceled and not happen). Additionally, for the rest of the turn, enemy Heroes next to you cannot perform skill actions (the primary action on skill cards). This is checked on their turn, so if the Hero is no longer adjacent to you, they would be able to perform skill actions again.\n• Wasp’s Gold can “interrupt” a skill that moves a hero next to Wasp (like Tigerclaw’s Primary Green, _Master Thief_): they will not be able to perform the rest of the action.",

    "faq-common-OmbzNwt1.answer": "Basically everything. An immune unit can’t be targeted or affected by any action. They can choose to move through and ignore tokens.\nBeware that conditional immunity only applies when the sources of an effect matches the condition (eg. “immune to enemy attack actions”)",
    "faq-common-J6uK9mGB.question": "Why is there a range 1 attack? Isn’t that non-ranged?",
    "faq-common-J6uK9mGB.answer": "A range of 1 can only target an adjacent space (but the range may be increased by items or other effects). A range of 0 has no targets.\nSome cards **explicitly** interact with ranged or non-ranged attacks.",
    "faq-common-5eb64zdk.question": "Is Fast Travel the same thing as movement?",
    "faq-common-5eb64zdk.answer": "No. Fast Travel is a special type of action that usually replaces a Movement action. They are related but different:\n\n- When you would take a Movement action, you can fast travel instead.\n- If you use a primary Movement action to Fast Travel, you would ignore the card text, since you are replacing the action.\n- A card that lets you move (“Move 2 spaces…”) would not let you Fast Travel instead.\n- If you are prevented from moving or from taking a Movement action, you could not use a Movement action to Fast Travel.\n- If you are limited in how you move (“May only move 1 space”), you may still Fast Travel as normal, since you are allowed to select, then replace, the Movement action (and Fast Travel is a placement, not movement).",
    "faq-common-Xe16hzf0.question": "Does my effect trigger next round?",
    "faq-common-Xe16hzf0.answer": "No. Active effects always “clear” at the end of the round: A “next turn” effect played on Turn 4 will **not** carry over to the next round.",
    "faq-common-Xe16hz1a.question": "What are Obstacles?",
    "faq-common-Xe16hz1a.answer": "Obstacles are basically anything on the map: Units (Heroes and Minions), terrain shown on the map, tokens, and any other miniatures. There can only be one Obstacle on each space, and Obstacles generally can’t move through each other. If an ability does allow Obstacles to pass through each other (“you can move through Obstacles”, ignore Obstacles”, “Heroes may move through a space with a tree token”), they still may not end movement on such a space.",
    "faq-common-fizzle.question": "Can I play an action if only some of its instructions can be performed?",
    "faq-common-fizzle.answer": "You **must** follow the cards instructions step by step, starting from the top.\n- If you cannot perform the first instruction (e.g., there is no valid target in range, or you cannot make the required movement), you may not perform the action at all.\n- After the first instruction is successfully exectued, you continue resolving the rest of the instructions in order.\n- If you reach an instruction that is not optional and you cannot perform it, the action immediately **fizzles** — no further instructions are resolved. You place the card on your hero dashboard, and your turn ends.\n_See page 10 of the rulebook for additional reference._"
