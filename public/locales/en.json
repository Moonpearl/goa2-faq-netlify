    "faq-ari-p7QWkUE0.question": "Do Arien’s green skill cards perform movement?",
    "faq-ari-p7QWkUE0.answer": "No. The primary Green **places** Arien, the alternative Green **swaps**. These are not movement and are not restricted by effects that restrict movement.",
    "faq-ari-5OTmpo8i.question": "What does Arien's Slippery Ground restrict?",
    "faq-ari-5OTmpo8i.answer": "This card restricts the movement, by a movement action, of Heroes in radius. It will **not** affect pushing, swapping, or placement effects (including fast travel!). It also will **not** restrict movement as part of other actions (such as Brogan’s Primary Red or Tigerclaw’s Primary Green).\nAdditionally, because movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of a movement, a Hero can freely move into and through the radius of Arien’s effect without being affected.",

    "faq-bai-g0LnJfSb.answer": "A Bounty Marker doesn’t do anything by itself. If Bain’s enemy is defeated that round, they spend an additional life counter (and return the Marker). At the end of the round, the Bounty Marker is returned. If Bain is defeated, the Marker is not returned.",
    "faq-bro-UGm22plF.question": "Is the movement required?",

    "faq-bro-fbDz04ez.answer": "Yes! If Brogan cannot move 2 spaces in a straight line to a space adjacent to an enemy unit, the effect will “fizzle” — stop resolving — and he will not attack. A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.\n- Brogan can charge next to an immune unit, at which point his attack would fizzle.\n- Brogan can charge through Min’s Smoke Bomb Token, since the Smoke Bomb only prevents targeting across the Smoke Bomb and Brogan would not target until after the movement.",
    "faq-bro-U8USFZ6w.question": "Does Brogan’s Primary Green (Shield) work during Minion Battle?",

    "faq-common-5eb64zdk.question": "Is Fast Travel the same thing as movement?",
    "faq-common-5eb64zdk.answer": "No. Fast Travel is a special type of action that usually replaces a Movement action. They are related but different:\n\n- When you would take a Movement action, you can fast travel instead.\n- If you use a primary Movement action to Fast Travel, you would ignore the card text, since you are replacing the action.\n- A card that lets you move (“Move 2 spaces…”) would not let you Fast Travel instead.\n- If you are prevented from moving or from taking a Movement action, you could not use a Movement action to Fast Travel.\n- If you are limited in how you move (“May only move 1 space”), you may still Fast Travel as normal, since you are allowed to select, then replace, the Movement action (and Fast Travel is a placement, not movement).",
    "faq-common-Xe16hzf0.question": "What are Obstacles?",
    "faq-common-Xe16hzf0.answer": "Obstacles are basically anything on the map: Units (Heroes and Minions), terrain shown on the map, tokens, and any other miniatures. There can only be one Obstacle on each space, and Obstacles generally can’t move through each other.

    "faq-cut-J96IkUe0.answer": "Any obstacle (units, tokens, terrain, or other miniatures) can be targeted by Grappling Bolt. This includes immune units as well as the terrain spaces around the edge of the map (she can grapple onto the water).",
    "faq-dod-DYMXRSjX.question": "What is an “empty minion spawn point in the battle zone”?",
    "faq-dod-DYMXRSjX.answer": "Dodger’s magic (thematically) grows stronger as minions are defeated. Many of her cards check for “empty minion spawn points in the battle zone.” These are the minion spawn points printed on the board, but only the ones in the current battle zone — there is only 1 battle zone (2, on the 2-lane map). Only empty spaces (with **nothing** on them) are counted.",
    "faq-dod-9oAe2b05.question": "What minions can Dodger respawn with her Necromancy?",
    "faq-dod-9oAe2b05.answer": "She can return a friendly defeated/removed minion of any type to any spawn point. \n- It need not be a matching minion type or color: if her friendly ranged minion is defeated, Dodger could respawn it on an enemy melee minion spawn point. \n- It must be a minion that was originally in play in this wave, before being defeated or removed. Dodger cannot “respawn” a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",
    "faq-gar-XgL3MPkL.question": "Does Garrus’s Silver (Chilling Howl) slow an enemy moving into radius from outside?",
    "faq-gar-XgL3MPkL.answer": "No. Movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of movement, so a hero within Garrus’s radius is affected, but a hero moving into the radius will complete their full movement value.",
    "faq-gar-RuXRiXjv.question": "Can Garrus’s Alt Reds (Blunt Force) move away from one hero to another?",
    "faq-gar-RuXRiXjv.answer": "If your attack against an opposing hero does not defeat them, they will still be adjacent to you. There are several valid options for movement: you could move to a different space adjacent to the hero you attacked, or if you are adjacent to a different enemy hero, you may move to another space adjacent to them. You may not move away from your initial target to a different enemy hero that was not originally adjacent to you, since the original target would have been the nearest enemy hero.",
    "faq-neb-QxJOvtUS.question": "Gold (Mind Grip)?",
    "faq-neb-QxJOvtUS.answer": "This card has lots of weird interactions:\n- Mind Grip is only played as a skill action on your turn. You could not use Mind Grip’s copy ability to copy a card while defending.\n- Active effects he copies will work normally, as though Neb’s Gold was an exact copy of the card. The effect remains, even if the originally copied card changes state or the hero is defeated.\n- When NebKher copies effects that place tokens, he places Illusion tokens instead. They will not take on the properties of the copied tokens.\n- If NebKher copies cards that specifically refer to tokens, NebKher uses those tokens as those heroes would (such as Min’s mines or smoke bombs, or Wuk’s trees).\n- NebKher can copy Trinkets’ cards to remove and/or place the Turret.\n- If NebKher copies an action that says “this card”, it means the card with the printed ability, not Neb’s. He cannot copy Brogan’s Silver (Bullwark), for example, then retrieve his Gold.\n- Although it can copy attacks, Mind Grip is a skill card, so some card resolutions may happen differently. Examples:\n     - If NebKher copies a non-ranged attack, he is performing a non-ranged attack (even though his Gold card is a ranged skill). A non-ranged attack he is using could not be blocked by Tigerclaw’s Primary Blue (Dodge) or Wasp’s Primary Green(Stop Projectiles), both of which only block ranged attacks.\n     - If NebKher copies Trinkets’ Primary Red (Makeshift Minigun), he will get a range bonus on the next turn. If he is subsequently hit by Wasp’s Gold (Dazzling Dagger), the active +range bonus copied from Trinkets is canceled).\n- If NebKher copies Igantia’s Silver (Moment of Equilibrium), he will re-set the coin to a side of his choice. (Ignatia only prevents ties from changing it.)\n- NebKher cannot copy the card of an immune hero.",
    "faq-neb-lR0UngYk.question": "NebKher’s Silver (Diabolical Laughter) says you need to laugh diabolically. Do you really need to laugh diabolically?",
    "faq-neb-lR0UngYk.answer": "Of course not: there are 21 other heroes to play.",
    "faq-neb-nRunMRdC.question": "What about units on the line drawn by NebKher’s Alt Blue (Crack in Reality)?",

    "faq-sabina-AR1boyR4.question": "Does Sabina gain the attack bonus against Heroes who have played but not resolved an attack card?",
    "faq-sabina-AR1boyR4.answer": "Yes: the card only checks for Heroes that **played** an attack card, regardless of whether they’ve resolved the action, which action they performed, and even whether this is still their card for the turn (it will “remember” whether they have played a card, even if it is discarded or switched for another card by an effect).",
    "faq-sil-VBPVBU86.question": "When can Silverarrow’s Gold Fast Travel?",
    "faq-sil-VBPVBU86.answer": "The Fast Travel has all the normal restrictions of a Fast Travel action: there must be no enemy Heroes or Minions in her Zone, and if not, she can move anywhere in her Zone or to an adjacent Zone with no enemy Heroes or Minions.\n_Note that this is a rare instance of a Fast Travel which is not replacing a movement action. Silverarrow could Fast Travel (if valid), even if she cannot move due to another effect._",
    "faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.question": "Does Silverarrow’s Primary Blue (Grasping Roots) affect a Hero who moves in range of Silverarrow during their movement?",

    "faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.question": "What communication is legal for Tali’s Silver (Commune With Spirits)?",
    "faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.answer": "All Table Talk and Communication is fully open - to teammates and opponents (p. 4). A Tali player can give teammates instructions like “Say Blue” or “Say Red if Sabina plays Gold, otherwise say Green,” as long as the opponents can hear (and understand) these instructions. The Tali player may not secretly indicate their desire to their teammates by whispering, gestures, showing cards, a private code, etc.",
    "faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.question": "If Tali tries to resolve her Silver (Commune with the Spirits) and her whole team is dead or immune, what happens?",

    "faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.answer": "No. The Totem is removed instead of the minion being defeated, so no minion is defeated and no coins are gained.",
    "faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.question": "Does Tigerclaw’s Blink Strike attack require movement?",
    "faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.answer": "Yes! If Tigerclaw cannot move through the target in a straight line, the effect will “fizzle” — stop resolving — and he will not attack. A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.",
    "faq-tig-mkia6OEY.question": "How does Tigerclaw’s Silver (Blend into Shadows) activate?",
    "faq-tig-mkia6OEY.answer": "Tigerclaw must begin his turn adjacent to an obstacle (including any unit), then place himself into a space in radius that is not adjacent to an enemy unit. If he does so, he will be immune and can move through units during the next turn. Remember that immunity means he cannot be targeted or affected by any action, can move through tokens (not stop movement on them), and may ignore token effects.",
    "faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.question": "Does Tigerclaw’s green thievery skill require an enemy hero?",
    "faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.answer": "Yes, to perform it completely. After Tigerclaw performs the first movement on the card, it checks for an adjacent enemy hero to steal from. If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card “fizzles” — stops resolving — and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n - Note that Tigerclaw can move next to an enemy hero with no coins (or whom he chooses not to rob) in order to get the full movement.\n - If Tigerclaw is not able to move 2 spaces in a straight line, he will not make the final movement at all.\n - There are cases where performing Primary Green without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien’s Alt Blue or Xargatha’s Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.",
    "faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.question": "What happens if Tigerclaw’s poison reduces a value below 1?",
    "faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.answer": "Values can drop to 0 and even be negative:\n- Initiative values are resolved in the normal order from highest to lowest.\n- Negative defense values are calculated normally and may still block an attack if the Defense Total is greater than or equal to the Attack Total.\n- Negative Attack Totals will still defeat a Minion and must still be defended against (or will defeat the hero).",
    "faq-tri-Gy7gS7zz.question": "What is the Turret?",
    "faq-tri-Gy7gS7zz.answer": "It’s an obstacle and counts as terrain. It’s not a unit, minion, or hero, and it doesn’t do anything other than as instructed by Trinkets’ cards. The Turret’s presence and counting as terrain are properties, not an active effect, so they don’t change if Trinkets’ cards change zones, between rounds, or if Trinkets dies. You’re limited to the single provided Turret, so placing a Turret while it’s already on the map will reposition it, not add a Turret. Several of Trinkets’ effects require a target in range of Trinkets and the Turret, measuring the range of both of these independently.",
    "faq-tri-Q91NHrfO.question": "How do Trinkets cards target?",
    "faq-tri-Q91NHrfO.answer": "Several of Trinkets cards target based on the location of the Turret. While thematically the Turret is shooting them, Trinkets is still the one playing these cards, targeting enemies, etc.: the Turret only provides a targeting restriction. Therefore:\n- Arien’s Silver (Spell Break) could prevent a nearby Trinkets from using skills like Primary Blue (Disruptor Jolt) or Alt Green (Self-Destruct), even if the Turret is far away.\n- Min’s Silver (Smoke Bomb) can interrupt a Trinkets attack if the Smoke Bomb is between Trinkets and the taret, irrespective of the position of the Turret.",
    "faq-urs-znPgp2l0.question": "Does Ursafar gain coins for removing a minion on his Primary Red?",

    "faq-urs-ZpV2cmhu.question": "Would Ursafar’s Ultimate (Unbound Fury) allow him to move using his Silver (Angry Roar)?",
    "faq-urs-ZpV2cmhu.answer": "No. The second effect on Angry Roar, +2 Movement, will only increase the Movement value of a card which already has a Movement Action.",
    "faq-wasp-P8qD2hsM.question": "How does Wasp’s Static Barrier work?",
    "faq-wasp-P8qD2hsM.answer": "Static Barrier divides the map into 2 regions: spaces within its radius and outside its radius. Enemy units cannot **move** or **fast travel** across the “barrier” between the two regions:\n- They cannot take a move action (to move or fast travel) to move across the barrier.\n- They cannot use an attack or skill involving movement to cross the barrier.\n- They cannot cross the barrier on their path, even if they cross back. That is, a hero outside the barrier cannot walk into the radius and then walk back out.\n- They can use a “place” or “swap” effect (such as Arien’s Alt Blue) to cross the barrier.\n- They can be pushed across the barrier (pushing is not movement) or moved by another player’s card.",
    "faq-wasp-iOUfdU2P.question": "How does Wasp’s ability move units and tokens?",

    "faq-wasp-6LS6R1fC.question": "When does Wasp’s  push ability force a discard?",
    "faq-wasp-6LS6R1fC.answer": "This card pushes adjacent enemies away from you (in a straight line). If an enemy Hero cannot be pushed the full distance, because an obstacle is located along the straight line path, the Hero is forced to discard.",

    "faq-whi-TDtkq39W.question": "When Whisper plays Gold (Swift Justice) against an enemy Hero, how do they move?",
    "faq-whi-TDtkq39W.answer": "First, the targeted Hero chooses and discards a Card of their choice (if they have any cards remaining in hand). If they do so and the discarded Card has a movement value, that Hero must then move that distance in a straight line. They would only be unable to do so (and therefore stay on the same space) if they could not move the full movement value in a straight line in any of the 6 directions from their current space.",
    "faq-whi-2Sh4CgpI.question": "Does this ability require an enemy Hero? Can they pick an option that does nothing?",
    "faq-whi-2Sh4CgpI.answer": "Whisper’s Alternate Blue requires targeting an enemy Hero in range or it will fizzle and have no effect. That Hero then picks one of the two options, regardless of whether they will have any effect. In other words, the card won’t “work” unless Whisper is adjacent to a Minion.\n Note that on Tier III, Whisper can target 3 minions simultaneously. He cannot use this action to defeat the last non-Heavy Minion at the same time as the Heavy.",
    "faq-xar-uxm2IDQl.question": "What does Xargatha's Stone Gaze affect and not affect?",
    "faq-xar-uxm2IDQl.answer": "It prevents “movement actions”, that is, selecting the movement option when resolving a card:\n - ❌ They **can’t** use a normal movement action to move.\n - ❌ They **can’t** use a movement action to fast travel (which chooses, then replaces, a movement action).\n - ✅ They **can** use a “place” or “swap” effect (such as Arien’s Alt Blue).\n - ✅ They **can** be pushed or moved by another effect (if the effect ignores immunity).\n - ✅ They **can** take another action type that involves movement (such as Brogan’s Primary Red) or a Fast Travel (Silverarrow’s Gold).",
    "faq-xar-BBNWEowq.question": "Does Xargatha's Constrict affect heavy minions as well?",
